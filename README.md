## Introduction

In order to gain insights into a DVD rental store's operations and customer behavior the database of the store was analysed using PostgreSQL. 
The results from the analysis will show the following information:
* Total number of films in each category
* Top 5 customers who have rented the most films.
* Number of rentals per month for the past year.
* Total revenue generated by each store.

In addition, actionable insights and recommendations will be generated based on the analysis.
The implementation of this project will be achieved using the postgreSQL database where the datasets will be stored and pgAdmin to run the queries necessary to analyze the datasets
